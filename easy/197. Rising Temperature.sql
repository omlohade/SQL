-- Table: Weather

-- +---------------+---------+
-- | Column Name   | Type    |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- | id            | int     |
-- | recordDate    | date    |
-- | temperature   | int     |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- id is the column with unique values for this table.
-- There are no different rows with the same recordDate.
-- This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.
 

-- Write a solution to find all dates' id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

-- Return the result table in any order.

-- The result format is in the following example.

 

-- Example 1:

-- Input: 
-- Weather table:
-- +----+------------+-------------+
-- | id | recordDate | temperature |
-- +----+------------+-------------+
-- | 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
-- | 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
-- | 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
-- | 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
-- +----+------------+-------------+
-- Output: 
-- +----+
-- | id |
-- +----+
-- | 2  |
-- | 4  |
-- +----+
-- Explanation: 
-- In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
-- In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).


SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather w1
JOIN Weather w2
  ON w1.recordDate = DATE_ADD(w2.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
WHERE w1.temperature > w2.temperature;



-- Select the id from today's record (w1)
SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather w1
-- INNER JOIN with the same Weather table (alias w2), representing "yesterday"
JOIN Weather w2
  -- ON condition: Match today's date (w1.recordDate) with yesterday + 1 day
  -- This ensures we are comparing each day to its previous day's record
  ON w1.recordDate = DATE_ADD(w2.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY)

-- Now, filter the pairs where today's temperature (w1.temperature)
-- is greater than yesterday's temperature (w2.temperature)
WHERE w1.temperature > w2.temperature;
